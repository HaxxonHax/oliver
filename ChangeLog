	  growing indefinitely....doh!

2004-05-04  Veghead  (veg@fatsquirrel.org)
	* Renamed to 'Oliver' due to request from some other 'WebShare'

2004-01-24  Veghead  (veg@fatsquirrel.org)

	* Made the file icons links to the files, but with 
	  application/octet-stream as the MIME type. I'm hoping that this
	  will effectively provide a "download" option. It does in Mozilla,
	  but not being someone who enjoys the pain of IE I don't know.
	  Feedback anyone ?

	* Fixed some totally stupid code that should make the whole 
	  thing more compatible with other FTP servers. Certainly seems to
	  work ok with PureFTPd now anyway.
