Quick and dirty install instructions
------------------------------------

Unpack the distribution somewhere accessible by your web server:

	gzip -dc oliver-x.xx.tgz | tar xvf - 


You need a directory for uploaded files. They must 
be writable by the webserver, but not readable! The simplest, but least 
secure method of doing this is:

	chmod 777 ftp_cache

The .htaccess files in the directory should protect the contents,
but only if you have htaccess files enabled in your apache config!

If you wish to upload files you have to set certain php.ini values:

    file_uploads=1
    upload_max_filesize=200M

The best, and most secure solution is to read and understand the 
documentation for your web server and operating system.

You can create a file called 'motd.php' which will be included into the login 
page - here you can put messages, instructions etc.

It's probably a good idea to regularly run something to delete old entries
from ftp_cache.

Next, copy config-dist.php to config.php:
    cp config-dist.php config.php

Uncomment and change any settings you think you will need. These settings override the defaults in config-core.php.

Finally, point your browser to check.php on the webserver where Oliver is installed.

    e.g.
        https://yourserver.com/oliver/check.php

It will check your installation for some basic misconfiguration errors.

er...that's it.

Edit the style sheet, the header, loginform, and footer to customise the look 
and feel. Of course this then makes upgrades more tricky. Any ideas ?
